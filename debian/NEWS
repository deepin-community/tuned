tuned (2.24.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The profiles shipped in the package were moved from /usr/lib/tuned/
  to /usr/lib/tuned/profiles/.
  User added profiles are now expected in /etc/tuned/profiles/.
  You can change where tuned looks for profiles using the
  `profile_dirs` option in /etc/tuned/tuned-main.conf
